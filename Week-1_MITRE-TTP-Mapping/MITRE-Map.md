# MITRE TTP Mapping

## Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive mapping of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework. It serves as a reference for understanding the behaviors and methods used by threat actors, specifically focusing on APT28.

## Tactics and Techniques

| Tactic                | Technique ID | Technique Name                     | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|--------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Initial Access        | T1071.001    | Application Layer Protocol         | Use of application layer protocols for command and control.                |
| Execution             | T1203        | Exploitation for Client Execution  | Exploiting vulnerabilities in client applications to execute malicious code.|
| Persistence           | T1050        | New Service                        | Creating a new service to maintain persistence on the target system.       |
| Privilege Escalation  | T1068        | Exploitation of Elevation Control  | Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain elevated privileges.                     |
| Defense Evasion       | T1027        | Obfuscated Files or Information    | Using obfuscation techniques to evade detection.                           |
| Credential Access     | T1003        | Credential Dumping                 | Extracting credentials from the operating system or applications.          |
| Discovery             | T1087        | Account Discovery                   | Identifying user accounts on the system.                                   |
| Lateral Movement      | T1021.001    | Remote Services                     | Using remote services to move laterally within the network.               |
| Collection            | T1005        | Data from Local System             | Collecting data from local systems for exfiltration.                      |
| Exfiltration          | T1041        | Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel | Using command and control channels for data exfiltration.                 |
| Impact                | T1486        | Data Encrypted for Impact          | Encrypting data to disrupt access and operations.                          |

## Conclusion
Understanding the TTPs associated with APT28 is crucial for developing effective defense strategies and improving incident response capabilities. This mapping serves as a foundational resource for cybersecurity professionals engaged in threat analysis and mitigation efforts.
