# DC-1 Root Access Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the steps taken to gain root access on the DC-1 vulnerable machine. It includes the methodologies used, tools employed, and any relevant findings during the process.

## Environment Setup
- **Virtual Machine**: DC-1
- **Operating System**: [Specify OS version]
- **Tools Used**:
  - [List any tools used, e.g., Nmap, Metasploit, etc.]

## Steps to Gain Root Access

### 1. Initial Reconnaissance
- Conducted network scanning to identify open ports and services running on the DC-1 machine.
- Tools used: Nmap

### 2. Service Enumeration
- Enumerated services running on open ports to identify potential vulnerabilities.
- [Detail any specific findings, e.g., version numbers, known vulnerabilities]

### 3. Exploitation
- [Describe the exploitation process, including any vulnerabilities leveraged]
- [Include commands or scripts used during this phase]

### 4. Privilege Escalation
- [Detail the methods used to escalate privileges to root]
- [Include any tools or techniques, e.g., kernel exploits, misconfigurations]

### 5. Post-Exploitation
- [Discuss any actions taken after gaining root access, e.g., creating backdoors, data exfiltration]

## Conclusion
- Summarize the overall experience and any lessons learned during the process of gaining root access on the DC-1 machine.
