# Passive Reconnaissance Techniques

Passive reconnaissance is a critical phase in the information gathering process, where an attacker collects information about a target without actively engaging with the target systems. This document outlines various techniques and tools used in passive reconnaissance.

## Techniques

1. **WHOIS Lookup**
   - Use WHOIS databases to gather information about domain ownership, registration details, and contact information.

2. **DNS Interrogation**
   - Query DNS records to obtain information about domain names, IP addresses, and mail servers associated with the target.

3. **Social Media Profiling**
   - Analyze social media platforms to gather insights about employees, organizational structure, and potential attack vectors.

4. **Search Engine Queries**
   - Utilize advanced search operators to find sensitive information that may be publicly available on the internet.

5. **Public Records and Databases**
   - Access public records, such as business registrations and court records, to gather additional information about the target.

6. **Network Mapping**
   - Use tools like Shodan to identify devices and services exposed to the internet that belong to the target organization.

## Tools

- **Maltego**
  - A powerful tool for link analysis and data mining that can visualize relationships between entities.

- **Recon-ng**
  - A web reconnaissance framework that provides a powerful environment for open-source web-based reconnaissance.

- **theHarvester**
  - A tool for gathering email accounts and domain/subdomain names from different public sources.
